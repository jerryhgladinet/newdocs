Reports
=======

CentreStack provides several built‑in reports that help administrators understand system usage, monitor user activity and comply with auditing requirements. Reports are accessible from the Reports section of the Tenant Manager.

Storage Reports
---------------

Storage reports provide insight into overall storage consumption and growth. Administrators can view:

* **Storage statistics** – total storage consumed, number of files and folders, and usage broken down by tenant or user. Charts show storage growth over time and help plan capacity.
* **Upload statistics** – number and size of files uploaded during a period.
* **Unused data** – identify data that hasn’t been accessed or modified recently to assist with cleanup and archiving.
* **Export** – export storage statistics to CSV or PDF for further analysis or billing.

User Activity
-------------

User activity reports monitor how users interact with the system:

* **Active users** – list users who have logged in during a specific time frame, their last login time and device count.
* **Device usage** – monitor the number and types of devices registered by each user.
* **Bandwidth usage** – track upload and download throughput per user or per device to identify heavy usage patterns.
* **Collaboration metrics** – see how many files a user has created, modified, shared or commented on.

Audit Logs
----------

Audit logs capture detailed records of all file operations and administrative actions. Logs include:

* **File operations** – upload, download, rename, move, delete, lock/unlock and version restore operations.
* **Sharing events** – creation of public links, invitations, external shares and expiry changes.
* **Authentication events** – user logins, logouts, failed logins and 2‑step verification attempts.
* **Administrative actions** – changes to settings, creation or deletion of tenants, team folders, users and groups.

Logs can be filtered by user, date range and activity type, and exported for compliance purposes.

Other Reports
-------------

Depending on your role and licensing, additional reports may be available:

* **Node Performance and System Diagnostics** – show CPU, memory and disk utilisation of CentreStack nodes to help diagnose performance issues.
* **Bandwidth Usage** – aggregate bandwidth consumption across the cluster.
* **Team Folder and Shared Object reports** – list all team folders, their owners, collaborators and storage usage, as well as all externally shared objects.
* **File Change Log** – summarises recent file modifications, additions and deletions.
* **Folder Permissions** – report on NTFS and CentreStack permissions for team folders and subfolders.
* **Distributed Locks** – monitor active file locks in the system, including who holds the lock and for how long.

These reports give administrators visibility into how the system is being used and help them maintain security, compliance and performance.
