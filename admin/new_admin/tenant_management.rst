Tenant Management
=================

Tenant Manager is where administrators manage tenants, users, groups, team folders, and Active Directory integration. This section explains how to navigate the Tenant Manager and configure these components.

Tenants
-------

A tenant is an isolated workspace for a customer or department. Administrators can create new tenants, assign storage quotas, and configure policies. The dashboard shows high‑level information about each tenant, including team folders, users, and alerts such as ransomware protection and data leak protection【647716952080395†screenshot】.

Users
-----

Users represent individual accounts within a tenant. Administrators can add native users, import accounts in bulk, or synchronize users from Active Directory【479535212585225†screenshot】. When adding a native user, you specify the user's email, password, and optional display name.

Groups
------

Groups are collections of users that simplify permission management. Create a group and assign multiple users; then grant group access to team folders.

Team Folders / Shared Workspaces
--------------------------------

Team folders are shared folders that users collaborate on. Administrators can grant or revoke permissions and manage access from file servers or cloud storage connectors.

Active Directory Integration
----------------------------

CentreStack integrates with Active Directory (AD) to synchronize users and groups. Administrators can connect a tenant to an on‑premises AD, choose synchronization options, and map AD groups to CentreStack roles and permissions.

Licenses and Quotas
-------------------

This subsection explains how to allocate user licenses and storage quotas to tenants. Administrators can view current usage and adjust quotas as needed.
