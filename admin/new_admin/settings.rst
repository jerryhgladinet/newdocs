Settings
========

The Settings area provides tenant-level controls for authentication, security policies, integrations, and other features. Each setting can be toggled or configured by administrators.

Active Directory settings
-------------------------

Toggle integration with on-premises or Azure AD connectors. You can specify synchronization schedules and decide whether user attributes are imported automatically.

Single Sign-On (SAML Integration)
---------------------------------

Set up SAML-based Single Sign-On with identity providers. You'll need to configure the SAML metadata, certificate, and mapping rules.

2-Step Verification (MFA)
-------------------------

Enable or disable multi-factor authentication for users. When MFA is enabled, users must provide an additional verification code during login.

Ransomware Protection
---------------------

Overview of built-in ransomware protection policies. You can define detection thresholds, notification options, and rollback behaviour.

File Locking
------------

File locking prevents multiple users from editing the same file at the same time. This section explains how to enable file locking and customize lock duration.

Data Leak Protection (DLP)
--------------------------

DLP policies help administrators control sharing of sensitive data. You can define rules to block public links, enforce passwords, or restrict external sharing.

Notifications
-------------

Configure email and in-app notifications. Administrators can choose which events trigger alerts (e.g., user invitations, file changes).

Email Service
-------------

Define outbound email settings, including SMTP server details, sender name, and reply-to address.

Clients & Applications
-----------------------

Manage policy settings for the Windows, Mac, and mobile client applications. This includes auto-update behaviour and default installation options.

SharePoint Online Integration
-----------------------------

Connect to Office 365/SharePoint Online to enable editing documents in the web. Provide the necessary credentials and site URLs.

Folder & Storage
----------------

View and configure underlying storage for tenants, such as file server locations and cloud buckets. You can connect new storage volumes and set quotas.
