(Screenshot placeholder: tenant-scope-per-tenant-teamfolder-clicked-add-team-folder-screen1-expand-file-server-local-area-network-view.png – depicts the **Add Team Folder** wizard with the **File Servers in Local Area Network** category expanded.  Within this section you can manually configure a new file server (represented by a pencil icon), and any already‑configured local file servers (e.g., **tthcgxsv03**) are listed as selectable targets for the new team folder.  Other storage categories remain collapsed in this view.)
