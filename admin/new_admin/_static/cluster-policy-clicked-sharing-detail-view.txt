(Screenshot placeholder: cluster-policy-clicked-sharing-detail-view.png – This placeholder applies to the **Sharing** settings page of the default group policy.  The breadcrumb navigation reads “Tenant Manager > Cluster Dashboard > Default Group Policy > Sharing.”  The page displays a series of toggles controlling file and folder sharing behaviour, such as requiring users to log in before they can access files shared with them, disabling external sharing of home directories, enabling internal share URLs, hiding the user and guest lists in sharing dialogs, disabling public links entirely, and requiring approval for external guest accounts.)
