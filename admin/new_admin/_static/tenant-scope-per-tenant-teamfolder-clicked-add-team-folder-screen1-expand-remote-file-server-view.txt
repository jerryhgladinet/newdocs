(Screenshot placeholder: tenant-scope-per-tenant-teamfolder-clicked-add-team-folder-screen1-expand-remote-file-server-view.png â€“ shows the **Add Team Folder** wizard with **Remote File Servers** expanded.  The page states that no remote servers are found and instructs administrators to install the **Server Agent** on a file server before it appears here.  A description explains that the agent runs as a Windows service and can act as a cloud file server or proxy for existing file servers and Active Directory users.  Icons representing Windows Server 2012 and newer server versions illustrate the supported platforms.  Other categories (Existing Tenant Storage, File Servers in Local Area Network and Cloud Storage) are collapsed.)
