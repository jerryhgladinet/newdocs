(Screenshot placeholder: cluster-policy-clicked-client-settings-manager-mapped-drive-control-detail-view-1.png – captures the first part of the **Mapped Drive Control** settings in the **Client Settings Manager**.  Numerous check boxes control how the CentreStack mapped drive behaves: hide the large file download tracker, disable folder move confirmations, always allow picture or PDF preview, avoid showing items as offline when there is no cache, hide storage quota, allow shortcuts, disable mounting drives on the server agent, automatically open the mounted drive on client startup, suppress file change notifications and editing/preview disabled notices, enable in‑place opening of ZIP/EXE files, and use Windows credentials to enable Single Sign On.  Fields at the bottom define the maximum size of ZIP files that can be opened in place and the maximum file size for generating thumbnails.)
