(Screenshot placeholder: management_scope.png – presents a hierarchical diagram of the management scope.  At the top sits the **Partner Portal**, which handles licensing.  Two deployment models branch out: **Self‑Hosted CentreStack** (with single‑tenant and multi‑tenant clusters) and **Hosted CentreStack** (multi‑tenant only).  Each branch ends with tenant icons connected to file servers, illustrating that licences issued through the partner portal cover both self‑hosted and hosted deployments and showing how tenants and storage resources relate in each model.)
