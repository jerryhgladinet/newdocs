(Screenshot placeholder: cluster-dashboard-clicked-reports-and-then-system-diagnostic-report.png – This screenshot corresponds to the **System Diagnostic Report** tab in the Reports area.  In the Reports navigation, the administrator has clicked the **System Diagnostic Report** link.  The page contains explanatory text telling you that the cluster will collect configuration, log files and system information into a zip file which can be downloaded and sent to support.  A prominent blue button labelled **Start system scan** appears in the centre of the page.  Underneath, there is a section showing any previously generated diagnostic reports with a download link.)
