(Screenshot placeholder: cluster-policy-clicked-client-settings-manager-mapped-drive-control-detail-view-2.png – displays additional **Mapped Drive Control** options after scrolling down.  Here you can assign a **Drive Letter**, set a **Cache Size Limit** and a **Minimal Free Disk Space** threshold, and specify how many days to keep the logging database before purging.  A check box for **Mount Drive in global space** (Windows clients only) determines whether the drive is mounted outside of the User Account Control space so it is visible to other users on the same machine.  Further options include showing only cached files in offline mode, disabling check‑out, using the Windows default browser to open files/folders, encrypting the local cache, always syncing folder metadata when browsing in Explorer, and disabling AutoCAD optimization.  These settings provide fine‑grained control over the mapped drive experience.)
