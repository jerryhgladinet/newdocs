(Screenshot placeholder: cluster-policy-clicked-client-settings-manager-outlook-plugin-detail-view.png â€“ shows the **Outlook Plugin** configuration in the **Client Settings Manager**.  You can set a file size threshold (in KB) for when the plugin prompts users to convert attachments to links (0 means always convert).  Another field defines the **default folder** where attachments sent through the plugin should be stored (`/folder/subfolder`).  A dropdown control sets the **link expiration time**, with options like *Never*.  These settings help integrate CentreStack with Microsoft Outlook.)
