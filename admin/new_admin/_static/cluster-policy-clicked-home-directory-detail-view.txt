(Screenshot placeholder: cluster-policy-clicked-home-directory-detail-view.png – This placeholder refers to the **Home Directory** policy page inside the default group policy.  The breadcrumb trail reads “Tenant Manager > Cluster Dashboard > Default Group Policy > Home Directory.”  The page presents options for naming and creating user home directories.  You’ll see fields for specifying a naming pattern (such as `{user}@{tenant}`), a toggle for automatically creating the home directory when the user signs in, and an option to restrict users from changing their home directory.  Additional settings may include whether the home directory is created under a specified tenant root and if network shares are automatically added.)
