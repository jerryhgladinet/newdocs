Two line charts are displayed: **“Bandwidth usage in last 60 minutes (Upload)”** and **“Bandwidth usage in last 60 minutes (Download)”**, both with time along the x‑axis. Beneath the charts are two tables titled **“top 10 tenants with bandwidth usage”** and **“top 10 users with bandwidth usage”**, which are empty in this screenshot. A navigation row across the top lists the report tabs: **Upload Report**, **Storage Statistics**, **Active Users**, **Guest Users**, **Node Performance**, **Bandwidth Usage** (selected) and **System Diagnostic Report**. A reporting period drop‑down is set to **Last 1 hour**.)
