(Screenshot placeholder: cluster-dashboard-clicked-worker-node-to-node-list-view.png – This placeholder describes the **Worker Nodes** list under the Server Farm menu.  When the cluster administrator clicks **Worker Node** in the Cluster Dashboard, a page appears listing all registered worker nodes in a table.  Columns typically include **Node Name**, **Private IP**, **Public IP/Port**, **Status**, **Operating System**, and **Last Check‑in** time.  On a brand‑new cluster this table may display a note such as “No worker nodes found,” with an option to register a new node.)
