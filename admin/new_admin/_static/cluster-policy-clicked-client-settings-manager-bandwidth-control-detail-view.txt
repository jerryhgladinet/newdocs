(Screenshot placeholder: cluster-policy-clicked-client-settings-manager-bandwidth-control-detail-view.png â€“ illustrates the **Bandwidth Control** section within the **Client Settings Manager**.  Administrators can set a **Download Bandwidth Limit** and **Upload Bandwidth Limit** in kilobytes per second (0 = unlimited), controlling how fast client devices transfer data.  A field for **Number of File Transfer Threads** determines how many simultaneous transfers are allowed.  At the top of the page an option allows uploading open files via Volume Shadow Copy.  These settings help throttle client network usage.)
