 (Screenshot placeholder: cluster-policy-clicked-attached-folder-detail-view-1.png – Displays the **Attached Folder** settings page within the *Default Group Policy* module.  The breadcrumb at the top reads “Tenant Manager > Cluster Dashboard > Default Group Policy > Attached Folder.”  The page lists a series of toggles that govern how attached folders and certain file types are handled by client devices.  Options include disabling backup/attachment of local folders from clients, enabling snapshot backup for the server agent, allowing the client to sync empty files and hidden files, and permitting specific file types such as executables (.exe), ISO images (.iso), backup files (.bak, .bkf, .rto, .rtb), and virtual machine images (.hdd, .hds, .pvm, .vdi, .vhd, .vmc, .vmdk, .vmem, etc.).  Additional switches control syncing of application folders and application data folders.  Near the bottom are fields to enable a scheduled sync for files with certain extensions and specify how often to run the scheduled sync.  Use this description to locate the screenshot showing multiple check‑boxes and text boxes for each of these policies.)
