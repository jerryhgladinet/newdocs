 (Screenshot placeholder: cluster-dashboard-clicked-reports-and-then-guest-users-report.png – This image depicts the **Guest Users** report within the cluster Reports area.  The sub‑navigation bar lists the report tabs with **Guest Users** selected.  A small blue badge indicates “1 of 1 guest users found.”  The table includes columns **Full Name**, **Email**, **Organization** and **Last Login**.  In this example there is one guest user row showing a user named Hui Jin with email `huij+guestuser@gladinet.com`, organization “Gladinet” and a last login timestamp.)
