(Screenshot placeholder: cluster-policy-clicked-password-policy-detail-view.png – This placeholder corresponds to the **Password Policy** page of the default group policy.  The breadcrumb header reads “Tenant Manager > Cluster Dashboard > Default Group Policy > Password Policy.”  The page includes settings for minimum password length, complexity requirements (e.g. inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters), password expiration days, and the number of remembered passwords.  There are also options for account lockout thresholds and duration after multiple failed login attempts.)
