(Screenshot placeholder: tenant_manager.png – illustrates the **Tenant Manager** page.  A tile labelled **New Tenant** with a plus sign allows you to create a new tenant.  Next to it is a card for an existing tenant (e.g., **My Tenant**) showing the cluster administrator’s name, the number of users and user licenses, and the amount of storage used.  The top bar provides tools to add, search and refresh tenants and displays trial days remaining.  This view gives cluster administrators quick access to manage and create tenants.)
