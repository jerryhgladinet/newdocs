 (Screenshot placeholder: cluster-policy-clicked-client-settings-manager-client-startup-script-detail-view.png – Represents the **Client Settings Manager** page in Default Group Policy, specifically the section dealing with bandwidth control and client start‑up behaviour.  The breadcrumb reads “Tenant Manager > Cluster Dashboard > Default Group Policy > Client Settings Manager.”  The first option is a check‑box labelled “Use Volume Shadow Copy to Upload Files being Opened,” followed by a **Bandwidth Control** section.  Within this section there are numeric text boxes for **Download Bandwidth Limit (KB/s, 0 = Unlimited)**, **Upload Bandwidth Limit (KB/s, 0 = Unlimited)** and **Number of File Transfer Threads**.  The lower portion of the page (not visible here) contains additional panels such as Client Start‑Up Script and Login settings.  Use this description to find the screenshot showing these bandwidth‑control fields.)
