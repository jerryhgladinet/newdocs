(Screenshot placeholder: cluster-policy-clicked-client-settings-retention-policy-detail-view.png – This screenshot illustrates the **Retention Policy** section within the Default Group Policy.  The breadcrumb line reads “Tenant Manager > Cluster Dashboard > Default Group Policy > Retention Policy.”  The page contains a series of number fields allowing the administrator to specify how long versioned files, deleted files, file change logs, audit traces and Mac client logs should be kept (in days).  Additional options include hiding the purge command in the web interface, suppressing email notifications when purging deleted content, and deciding whether deleted but unpurged items count against storage quotas.)
