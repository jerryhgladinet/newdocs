(Screenshot placeholder: cluster-dashboard-clicked-reports-upload-report-view.png – This description refers to the **Upload Report** tab under Reports.  The breadcrumb shows “Tenant Manager > Cluster Dashboard > Reports > Upload Report.”  The page displays four line graphs showing file upload activity over different time ranges: **Last 30 days**, **Last week**, **Last 24 hours** and **Last 60 minutes**.  Each chart has time on the horizontal axis and number of uploaded files on the vertical axis.  There is no table on this page—just the graphs for quick trend analysis.)
