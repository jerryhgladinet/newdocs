 (Screenshot placeholder: cluster-dashboard-clicked-reports-and-then-storage-statistics-view.png – This screenshot captures the **Storage Statistics** report under Cluster Dashboard > Reports.  The tab row shows **Upload Report**, **Storage Statistics** (selected), **Active Users**, **Guest Users**, **Node Performance**, **Bandwidth Usage**, **System Diagnostic Report** and **Audit Trace**.  The page consists of several panels: **Overall Statistics** summarising total files, total folders, total file size, average file size, tenant count, files per tenant, folders per tenant and space used per tenant; **Tenants with the Most Storage Usage** listing each tenant and their total usage (e.g., My Tenant with 13.08 KB and a Gadinet entry with 0 Bytes and 100 GB quota); **Users with the Most Storage Usage** listing users (Cluster Admin and Tenant_Jin) with their storage usage; and a **File Size Distribution** chart showing file sizes by bucket.  A note at the top states that this is not a real‑time report, as the information is provided from the background scan process.)
