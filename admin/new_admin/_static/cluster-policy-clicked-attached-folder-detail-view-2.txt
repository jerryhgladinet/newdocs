 (Screenshot placeholder: cluster-policy-clicked-attached-folder-detail-view-2.png – Continuation of the **Attached Folder** policies in Default Group Policy.  This image shows the lower portion of the same page, with options to configure scheduled sync behaviour and additional controls.  Fields include a drop‑down to choose how often to sync files matching the configured extensions (e.g. every 15 minutes) and check‑boxes labelled “Allow attaching folders in proxy mode” and “Always try to force user impersonation when accessing storage.”  Use this description to match the screenshot that continues the list of attached‑folder policies and shows the frequency selector and impersonation options.)
