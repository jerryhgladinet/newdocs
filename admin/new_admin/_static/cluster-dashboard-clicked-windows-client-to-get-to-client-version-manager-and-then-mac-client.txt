(Screenshot placeholder: cluster-dashboard-clicked-windows-client-to-get-to-client-version-manager-and-then-mac-client.png – this screenshot shows the **Client Version Manager** with the **Mac Client** tab selected.  It lists the current Mac client version and package filename (a DMG), and provides buttons for uploading a new Mac client package and pushing the update out to tenants.  Use this image when discussing how to manage and update the macOS client from the cluster dashboard.)
