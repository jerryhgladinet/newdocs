(Screenshot placeholder: cluster-policy-clicked-client-settings-manager-sync-throttle-detail-view.png – depicts the **Sync Throttle** configuration for Windows, Server Agent and Mac clients.  Administrators can enable **Throttle Sync** to control the bandwidth used during synchronization.  Additional fields set the throttled upload and download bandwidth in kilobytes per second (0 = unlimited) and define **Full Speed Sync Stop Hour** and **Full Speed Sync Start Hour** to specify when throttling begins and ends.  These settings override client‑side bandwidth controls.)
