 (Screenshot placeholder: tenant-scope-per-tenant-dashboard-main-view-with-left-panel-open.png – similar to the tenant dashboard, but the left navigation panel is expanded to show labels next to each icon (e.g., **Dashboard**, **Team Folders**, **Devices**, **Users**, **Reports**, **Settings**, **Branding** and **Client Downloads**).  The central panel lists **Team Folders (Shared WorkSpaces)** with a message that no team folders exist yet and a link to **Add a team folder**, while the right panel shows File Portal, Ransomware Protection and Data Leak Protection alerts.)
