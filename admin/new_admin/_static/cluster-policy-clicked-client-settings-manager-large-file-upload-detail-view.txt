(Screenshot placeholder: cluster-policy-clicked-client-settings-manager-large-file-upload-detail-view.png â€“ shows the **Large File Upload** settings in the **Client Settings Manager**.  Fields allow you to enable chunked uploading when a file exceeds a specified size (in megabytes) and set the chunk size used for breaking large files into pieces.  A check box enables the use of **Volume Shadow Copy** to upload files that are currently open.  These controls improve reliability when transferring very large files.)
